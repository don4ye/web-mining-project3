# Employ Matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot

## Overview
This project analyzes the execution time of two sorting algorithms—**Insertion Sort** and **Merge Sort**—on lists of varying sizes. Using Python and Matplotlib, we created visualizations to compare the efficiency of each algorithm as the list size increases.

## Project Structure
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the Python code for generating and visualizing data.
- **Plots**: Scatter and line plots illustrate the time complexity of both sorting algorithms.

## Data
The data sets used for analysis:
- **Sizes**: `[10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, 5000]`
- **Insertion Sort Times**: Time taken to sort lists of the above sizes.
- **Merge Sort Times**: Time taken to sort lists of the same sizes.

## Visualizations
1. **Character Frequency Distribution**: A bar plot that shows the frequency distribution of characters in a provided text.
2. **Random Number Sequence**:
   - Scatter and line plots display a sequence of random numbers on separate axes with varied styles and colors.
3. **Sorting Algorithm Comparison**: A combined line plot showing execution times for Insertion Sort and Merge Sort on the same axes, with `list size` on the x-axis and `time` on the y-axis. This chart includes a legend to distinguish between the two algorithms.

## Key Files
- `pyplot.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data visualization.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions.
